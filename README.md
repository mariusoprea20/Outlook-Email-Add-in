Email Plugin

The email plugin is being used to track all emails that are being sent out from your account.

Once the plugin is being installed(see the instruction document if install needed), you then click on "New Email" button and navigate to the three dots on the top right corner. 

You should now be able to see and click on "Show TaskPane" to display the task pane of the plugin. 

The moment you open the task pane, the email plugin will ask you to sign in with your outlook account for security purposes, and if account is succesfully authenticated, you will see "Login Succesfully" message and get access to the HTML input form.

From there, you can enter:
 1. alternative email platform to witch you want notifications to be sent out
 2. mobile phone (with extension +44) for SMS notifications. This part is optional and can be disabled by ticking the "Don't Send SMS" box. 
 3. Side Notes, this can be used as marking the emails with meaningful keywords such as "Important" or "Remember to contact the client in 2 days".

Please note that the email plugin uses Twilio API for the SMS notifications, and so your own mobile phone will first require to be recorded in the Twillio admin account to get the SMS notifications work on your phone.

The moment you click send, all details (alternative email, mobile phone and side notes) will be saved and each time you send out an email, you will be notified again on the alternative email address and mobile phone entered previously, with the same side note until you will change them through the same steps above or deactiate the plugin
